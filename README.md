# geocoding-with-js
Using Leafletjs and MapBox a Browser only application will be made.

The user will be able to type a series of addresses into a textbox.
Each time an address is entered, using JavaScript (fetch) to issue an asynchronous request
for the geocoding information.
A map will be displayed and a marker placed on the map corresponding to the location retured.

Each address the user enters will be listed to the right.
Clicking on an address previously submitted will automatically focus/center on that
particular location
